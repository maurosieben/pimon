Everytime the machine hosting the system server is changed, some files need to be updated. 
In order to do that you need to run an update script. 



1- Updating masterdash files: 

Log in on the machine hosting masterdash and run the following command:

sudo pimon/hostname_update/masterdash_update/update

The prompt will ask you the new hostname. Insert it and type "Enter". 


2- Updating dashboard files: 

Log in on each pi and run the following command:

sudo pimon/hostname_update/pi_update/update

Same as above.

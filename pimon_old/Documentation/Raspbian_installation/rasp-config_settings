There are a few changes to make when you install Raspbian on the SD before you can install dashboard package. 

The steps above are executed on Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool (raspi-config) which loads at the first time you boot the system and 
is always reacheble by typing rasp-config on a terminal.


1- Expand Filesystem (to make sure you are going to use the whole SD card).
2- Change User password to "ptcdashboard"
3- Enable Boot to desktop 
4- Internationalisation options -> Change keyboard Layout to English US (optional)

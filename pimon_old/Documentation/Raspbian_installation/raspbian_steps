 1- Download the latest Raspbian 

    wget -O raspbian_latest.zip http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest

 2- Extract the image
 
    unzip raspbian_latest.zip 

 3- Verify current devices mounted

    df -h 

 4- Insert the SD card 

 5- Type df -h again and notice the device(s) were not on the list before. It will be listed as something 
like "/dev/mmcblk0p*" or "/dev/sdd*" sometimes "/dev/sdb*" (where * is the partition number). As we want to 
write on the whole card we need to umount this partition. If Raspbian (or any distro)
had been written before the SD will also have other partitions. They need to be unmounted as well. 
     (If your device is not mounted skip step 6)
     You can run fdisk -l to find out the SD card name in case it is not mounted. 
     
 6- Unmount the devices related to the SD card

    umount /dev/sdb*  (where * is the partition number, and sdb can change)

 7- Write the image to the card

    dd bs=4M if= image_name.img of= /dev/device_name (sdb in the example above)

    PRECAUTIONS:
    -> Make sure that the of= argument is the right device, otherwise you can lose important data.
    -> The bs (block size) argument of 4M will usually work, if not try 1M, having in mind the process will
 take longer. 
    

If you want to have a report of the writing process you can use:

   sudo dd bs=4M if=2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img | pv | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb

   

 8- Run sync to ensure the write cache is flushed and you can unmount your SD card

 9- Remove your card, insert in the pi and have fun!
